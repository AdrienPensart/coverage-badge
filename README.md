# Coverage.py Badge

A small script to generate coverage badges using Coverage.py.

The badge template has been taken from [shields.io](http://shields.io/),
therefore it should look mostly good. (The spec is a bit stricter on the
margins, but I can't easily do text width calculations in Python so the margins
might not always be 4px.)
